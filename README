Math-Intersection-StraightLine version 0.01
===========================================

This module aims to find the intersection point of two straight lines. These
lines can be presented in different ways:

Sometimes these lines are not represented by equations like y=9x+5, but as

f = (20)  + lambda (40)
    (60)           (20)
    
And in other situations the lines are represented by two position vectors.

These representations are handled by this module. But you cannot mix up these
representations.
